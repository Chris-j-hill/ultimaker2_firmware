# ultimaker2_firmware

Experimental firmware used by University College Dublin Innovation Academy on several ultimaker 2 3d printers

this is a largely unverified suite of firmware configurations with modifications added to allow features 
such as altered menu configurations, and several features to better support for multi
extruder printing.  

this code is derived from the Ultimaker2Marlin firmware here: https://github.com/Ultimaker/Ultimaker2Marlin

this code may not be fully verified or kept up to date, there is no guarantee of it working as desired
